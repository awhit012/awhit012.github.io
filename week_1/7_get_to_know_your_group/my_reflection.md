I’d love to work for these guys: www.puddle.com

Learning Style: Aural and tactile aka listening and doing. I like to listen to an expert explain something really well, then forget all I just learned and dive in. I also talk to myself a lot when I’m thinking.

I haven't found where you we put our fears. So far my fears are of burning out. So far this week has made me feel mostly better. I like that we get background for all elements of what we are learning with links to many great resources.
