## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I had already set up git and GitHub following Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial. When I did that I learned many things, the most memorable of which is how you can use Terminal to interact with the web, which is very exciting! 

The difference between git and GitHub is as follows. Git is a program and method for keeping track of versions of projects. Imagine you are building a castle out of legos and you are on step 10. You realize on some previous step you must have used the wrong piece in your build, and now you need that piece. If your lego build had git versions, you would have a saved version of each step of the build, each with a discription of what you changed at that step. Say you realize that you used the wrong piece when you built tower 2. You could find the versioun at tower two, and revert your project to the step before it. Now you can make sure you use the right piece. That is what git allows you to do with a coding project. You can go back to the version before the error and start from there, instead of having to start over. GitHub takes this tool and makes it social. Now say we are working on this Lego castle together. You have come to step 10 and realized that the mistake happened building tower 2, and I built tower 2. With git but without GitHub, you could still find the version before tower 2 and rebuild from there. But now you would each have a different version of the project. Using GitHub, you could rebuild tower 2 and share your rebuild with me. Then I could encorporate your fixed version of tower 2 after looking at it and agreeing that it solved the problem. 

Developers use git so the don't get lost or have to start from scratch when something goes wrong. It makes a ton of sense to me because given the complexity of web applications and other programming projects this can save a tremendous ammount of time. 

I think I have enough experience using git and GitHub that it all makes sense to me so far. I look foward to understand git and GitHub more fully after having hands on experience actually collaborating on a project with other people using these tools.
