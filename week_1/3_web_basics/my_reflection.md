## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Two things I learned about the web: I learned the difference between the Web and the Internet. The web is what you call the network of all computers that are in some way or other connected to eachother. The internet is the collection of web pages and web apps that are essentially tools to make the web of computers communicate in a useful way. 

Second I learned that IP addresses are not kept track of on a single or a few servers, but throughout the web, including on my own computer. If an IP address changes, it could take up to 48 hours to update across the web. I wonder if this distributed way addresses are tracked is similar to the distributed way that Bitcoin keeps track of its transactions! 

When setting up an HTML site it is important to remember to make it compatible with older web browsers that can't read HTML5 and CSS3. Also it is important to remember that while relatively simple, HTML can represent text, files, buttons, sound files, and even video without using CSS or anything else. But its going to look pretty crappy. 

It felt good to see the page live. I've experienced this before, but I still did an audible "Whoo!" especially since I never made one go live in that way. Before I have used Heroku and Google App Engine. They all made me go "Whoo!"

I feel more solid in my understanding of the difference between the web and internet. I have heard people make the distinction before and was stil confused. The other day I read an article about how the "web of things" will transform into the "internet of things." This makes sense to me now. It means while now things like Fridges and TVs are connected to the web, in the future (soon), they will be able to interact with the internet and do things like tweet. I think that is right. 

Other resources: 
   I learned HTML when I was 10 years old and made a few websites, but had forgotten most of everything. (I remembered how terrible WYSIWYG is) About 7 months ago I did all of the HTML stuff on Code Academy. Also Michael Hartl's tutorial includes some good explanations of how the web works.
