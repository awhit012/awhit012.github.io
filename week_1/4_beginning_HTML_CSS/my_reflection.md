## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

What makes sense about HTML is that with proper indentation and an idea of what the tags are, its not too far off of WYSIWYG. By that I mean that if I insert an image in the HTML I can visualize pretty well where it will go. The simplicity of the format is what I'm getting at. What doesn't make sense to me so far is exactly how the links to other files work. At the moment my CSS isn't working at all, and I think its because it is not properly linking to the HTML file. I will keep working on this. 

What seems good about HTML is that it is easy to use. What seems bad is that the tags are far from Ruby's easy to read English-like syntax. In other words, it is not very flexible. 

My aha moment on this excersize was figuring out that if put the project folder in the github.io folder the site will go live! 

I worked through all of the HTML and CSS excercizes on codeacademy.com a few months ago and that was very helpful and fun.
