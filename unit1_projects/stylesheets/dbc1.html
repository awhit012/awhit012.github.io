	<h6> I hope life extension happens for real because I want to<br>
		 learn and build so many things! </h6>
		 <p> I am in love with my fiance, and we are both in love with learning new things. If I only live a regular ammount of time I will probably skip learning Latin and sailing. I hope to get to some basic A.I. programming. </p>
		 <p>I do stand up comedy here and there. I used to do it almost every night and wanted to be a professional and quit my day job. I was a cook.</p>
		 <p> I realized I didn't really want to tour the country by myself and sleep in hotels. I fell in love with programming and technology. I realized I can do many things, and that in fact today doing many things is probably the best way to make a living. I want to be a web developer with many awesome hobbies. </p>
