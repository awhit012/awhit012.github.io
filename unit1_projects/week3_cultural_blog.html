    <h2>Discussing an Emotional Conflict</h2>
      <p>I do stand up comedy, and I used to do it a lot and was a part of the community of comics in the bay area, and to a lesser extent I still am. (This conflict has nothing to do with why I do comedy less). This is a wonderful, yet far from drama-free group. Sometimes tensions run high. Years ago I was on a facebook group for Bay Area comics and noticed a comic I know being publically derided in the group in a way I thought was innapropriate. The offending comic was calling him, among other things, a retard. I happened to know that the comic to whom he was refering actually had mental illness so I defended him. The offending comic then started hurling insults at me, and I responded in kind. I then made a video pretending to be a cowboy and called him out to a comedy battle. He ended up threatening me with violence when I saw him in person. It was latter resolved by the fact that we don't see eachother very often, but we still needed to coexist in the community. He apologized to me, and I admitted that I thought that the video was silly and apologized.</p>

      <p>The source of the conflict was that I took issue with what I saw as bullying another comic.</p>

      <p>I handled the whole thing quite emotionally and with some naivite, ultimately making the situation worse. I think although I usually lean towards attack self or avoidance, I joined in with the others in the attack other category. I do think I was right to challenge his bullying. But the culture of insults on a comedy facebook group got the best of me, and I quickly lost the high ground. I think it could have been a pretty cool thing for me to do to make a silly video calling him out to a duel. I thought he would laugh and realize the whole thing was silly, and that he would either apologize and we'd move on, or he'd agree to a duel, and we'd have a fun comics only show somewhere and have a joke battle. I was wrong. He took it very seriously and was seriously pissed off. Being somewhat new to the scene, I was naive. I should have been more careful. If I could change how I handled it, I would have just said that I didn't think it was right to call people names and then ignored his insulting response. Sometimes the best solution is to not engage.</p>
      <p>I learned a lot from this experience. I learned that you can not judge how someone you don't know will react to your actions, especially on the internet. I learned that comedians sometimes take things more seriously than accountants. Mostly I learned to stay out of other peoples drama. </p>
