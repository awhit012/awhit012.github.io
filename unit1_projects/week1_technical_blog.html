            <h4>Puddle.com</h4>
              <p>Puddle is one of my favorite sites because it is an innovation in one of my areas of interest: disrupting the status quo in banking.</p>
              <p>My eye is most drawn to where it says "Hi, Alex.", and then to the information below. Standing further away this is still the case. This is probably the most important part of the site. (This home page assumes you have already signed up and logged in.) This section describes your status as far as money deposited, where it is deposited, how much if any you have borrowed, etc.</p>
              <p>The website is visually simple, open and elegant. The makers of this site know that you need more than great functionality, you also need great design.</p>
              <p>This site works on the monumental problem of exploitation of individuals by banking monopolies by introducing a methodology for individuals to lend money to their friends easily, keeping the value in the community rather than value being extracted from above. The content consists of the different groups of friends, or 'puddles', who has deposited what, and who has borrowed what.</p>
              <p>The content, focus and purpose of the site is highly practicile and serious, but also fun. The website manages to be professional enough to inspire the confidence people need to trust their money in the website, but also has an element of fun. Users are encouraged to share why they are borrowing, and it is fun to help your friends invest in their own futures.</p>
              <p> It is easy to find what you need on this site once you are signed up and logged in, but that process is still a little confusing. There are a couple different stages. First you are invited. This step will be eliminated once the site is out of Beta, which will make it simpler. Than you connect your facebook account to verify your identity. You are then invited to the welcome puddle. Then you must be invited again into one of the other puddles, or you can start your own and invite your friends. Once logged in it is easy to find your way around the content.</p>
              <p>After being on the site a while I feel inspired. You can see people borrowing from their friends to pay off credit cards with much higher interest rates, or invest in their businesses, go on vacation, etc. It is wonderful knowing they are getting a very low interest rate and that interest is being distributed back into their community. </p>
              <p>This site offers a service, which I have participated in, but not really used. I have deposited money into the Welcome Puddle, and formed a puddle and invited my friends. The difficulty is getting friends to deposite enough money for there to be a sizable enough pool of cash. I have not overcame this hurdle, but many have. When I have more time I will do another round of getting friends involved. </p>
            <h4>Ars Technica</h4>
              <p>Ars Technica is actually a favorite of Gannon, my group member who I worked on Wireframing with this week. I like it a lot actually. I am always on the lookout for good tech news sites with stories that interest me and a pleasurable user experience. I find it to be just that.</p>
              <p>Both up close and afar the eye is drawn to the featured story. I guess this is what they want, and whether or not that is the most important part of the page depends on the oppinion of the user. </p>
              <p>The site is elegant. Maybe a little cluttered, but that is difficult to avoid on news sites with a ton of content.</p>
              <p>The problem the website solves is a common one with many sites solving it in many ways. They write stories and display them on their page. The content is staff produced articles.</p>
              <p>I would describe the site as serious, compact, content-heavy, organized, and simple.</p>
              <p>It is easy to find content. The categories are logical and well laid out. The header makes it easy to find the content you want from any page and makes it esy to browse through all content.</p>
              <p>After a while I feel informed.</p>
              <p>The site sells advertising. Nothing for users to buy. </p>
            <h4>Ruby Monk</h4>
              <p>Ruby Monk is one of my favorite sites because it is so elegant and the tone is whimsical. It truly makes learning Ruby fun. </p>
              <p>The eye is drawn the simple heading 'Learn Ruby.' from both near and far. This is arguable the most important part of the website because it says what you can do on it. It is also a good representation of the site as a whole. Elegant and simple.</p>
              <p>The website is elegant, simple, clean, calming and pleasant.</p>
              <p>They set out to solve the problem of learning Ruby. Best of all they get all of the clutter and complexity out of the interface so you can really focus on the learning.</p>
              <p>The focus and purpose of the site is educational, practical, serious, fun and benevolent.</p>
              <p>Navigation is easy! After a while on the site I feel learned and inspired. Sometimes frustrated, but that is mostly because learning a programming language can be very challenging! They sell nothing! Not even adds! All revenue donated by way of 'Donate' button.</p>
