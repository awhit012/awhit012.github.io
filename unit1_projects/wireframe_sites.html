<h1>Wireframe Sites</h1>
	
	<h2>Puddle.com</h2>
		
		<p>Puddle is a website creates a methodology for friends to easily pool money and gain access to credit using Facebook for identity verification and PayPal for exchanging currency. The problems they solve are monumental! Empowering people who might not ordinarily have access to credit, and lending and borrowing while keeping all money in the community. This is solved mostly at the back end, but the front end has unique problems to solve as well. A user needs to keep track of their funds, what they have deposited and where, what they can borrow at what interest. They also need to be able to keep track of who else is in their puddles (shared pool of money). The visual challenge here is to have it all laid out in a way that makes sense and is visually pleasing, ie. not just a spreadsheet.</p>

	<h2>Ars Technica</h2>
		
		<p>Ars Technica is a tech news site. The problem the site solves is the need for quality, relevant news for people interested in technology and the web. The visual challenge is to have a lot of content, but organize it nicely so the page doesn't look too cluttered.</p>

	<h2>Ruby Monk</h2>
		
		<p>Ruby Monk is a interactive web application that teaches users to code in Ruby! The problem it solves is making Ruby fun and making the interface so easy that it doesn't distract from the users learning experience. The challenge is to create a elegant interface.</p>
