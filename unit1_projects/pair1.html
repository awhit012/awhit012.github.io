    <h2><strong>Pros to Pair Programming</strong></h2>
      <p>Pair programming has many benefits and advantages as compared to solo programming. It allows people to catch errors earlier. Having two people understand the code makes it easier to maintain. Also problem solving can be more dynamic and innovative, because two heads are better than one! Pair programming is important at DBC because it is teaches how to work well with other people and is an important employable skill.</p>
      <p>There is a driver and a navigator in each pair. The role of the navigator is to direct the session and give instructions to the driver. The role of the driver is to execute the navigator's directions by typing out code as the navigator specifies.</p>
    <h2><strong>Reflection</strong></h2>
      <p>This was the first real pairing session, and it felt really good! It was nice to have someone with more experience as a guide, and Molly was great to work with. I am surprised that I like it. I thought that between not being used to working with another person like that and not being used to using google hangouts that I would not like it or it would be difficult. It worked well for us to trade off driving and navigating and checkin in with eachother to make sure we were both feeling good. It didn't work so great at first trying to pair writing content, but with the guidence of our guide, we realized that wasn't what pairing was for, and just each busted out some content and gave quick feedback. </p>
