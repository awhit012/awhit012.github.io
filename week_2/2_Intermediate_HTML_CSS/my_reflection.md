# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

Web standards are necessary. Could they be better? Sure. But we need them in the same way that we need standardized electrical outlets. So our stuff works!

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

The standard structure mostly makes sense to me. Default padding, default font size, etc. 

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

Yes!  I like them because it requires less div ids and classes and makes the structure more apparent when looking at the HTML. 

* Why is reset.css necessary? 

reset.css is necessary because there are changes that are made to how browsers handle css. Some css can become out of date. reset.css updates the css to a new standard where necessary. From cssreset.com "Using a CSS Reset, CSS authors can force every browser to have all its styles reset to null, thus avoiding cross-browser differences as much as possible."

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

I've used Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE back in the day. I have noticed that. I don't think its good, if only because it makes life more difficult for developers. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
