# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

HI! I'm not sure how much our reflections are factored into our progress, but I just wrote a nice meaningful one of these into the browser and then the page crashed and I lost it. I've got to make sure I have time to finish everything else! So I'm not re-writing it, at least for now. But in summary, CSS3 gets more fun all of the time, even though UX and design are the least interesting elements of our curricula. :)

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
