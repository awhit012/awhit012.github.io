# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

My biggest challenge is structured breaks. I tend to try to keep pushing even when I need a break and am not being productive, and then let my break run too long. 

* How will you combat that? 

Of all of what I read I liked the Pomodoro Technique and the Tiny habits technique. I will set a timer for 25 minutes when I start work and then take a ten minute break. I will verbally reward myself when I adhere to this. Even for doing a good job taking a break. 

* What techniques will you try?

See above.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

I am going to take more breaks so I don't allow myself to get frustrated. Yesterday I got very frustrated because I was not taking breaks, and then when I didn't understand something right away or something didn't work right away I got more frustrated. If something doesn't work after a few tries, and I feel the irritation rising, I'll walk away from my computer for a few minutes. I will try to get to the end of the timer, but prioritize not feeling like pulling my hair out! If after a while I am not feeling like a break when the timer goes off I will set it to 30 minutes. The goal won't be to make it as long as I can however, just to get to around 45 minutes of good productive work.
