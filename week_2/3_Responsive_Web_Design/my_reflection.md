# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsive web design allows the web site or app to adapt to the many different sizes of browser windows and screens by using conditional css. I like it a lot! It is fun to make things happen! I think it is a very good and important practice. In the early days of smartphones I had an iPhone and I always had to zoom in on pages and scroll around and it was annoying! 

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

Smartphones and tablets have made responsive design go from a nice thing to do to a necessity. In the future we will have felxible screens, probably shapes other than rectangles too. Also wearables, even contact lenses. Responsive design is a good groundwork for the enormous flexibility sites will need in the future. 

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?


Visually impaired people use the web with site readers that read aloud the contents of the site. We should absolutley consider all kinds of peoples ability to access our sites. 

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

Learning about design, the responsive design makes a lot of sense, as does accesibility practices. It might be a good idea to combine the two concepts. That way if someone is visually impaired, they get a custom CSS similar to how a smartphone gets a custom css. This is a little off topic, but is about the web. Centralization is stupid! I'm looking forward to working on decentralized technologies and applying what I've learned at DBC!
