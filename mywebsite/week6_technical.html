    <h2>Functional Programming</h2>
      <p>From Wikipedia: "Functional programming emphasizes functions that produce results that depend only on their inputs."</p>
      
    <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
      <p>From Wikipedia: "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that represents the concept of "objects" that have data fields (attributes that describe the object) and associated procedures known as methods."</p>

      <h3> There are your basic definitions. What do they mean? Why use one over the other? </h3>
        <p>Functional Programming emphasizes functions that produce relults. Object Oriented Programming of course also has functions and is obviously concerned with results, however it emphasizes objects, rather than funcitons. The key difference here is that while both approaches have functions, in OOP the functions are contained within the objects.</p>
      <h3>When use what?</h3>
        <p>Food for thought in this from Stack Overflow:</p>
          <p> <small> Object-oriented languages are good when you have a fixed set of operations on things, and as your code evolves, you primarily add new things. This can be accomplished by adding new classes which implement existing methods, and the existing classes are left alone.
