    <h2>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h2>
      <h4>Powerful</h4>
      <p>JavaScript is an object oriented language. This means that every element (numbers (integers), words or sentences (strings), variables, even functions (small programs within programs) are all the same kind of thing: an object. This allows JavaScript to run functions on functions, making it very powerful. In fact, Java in its essence is functions within functions within functions. </p>
      
      <h4>Lightweight</h4>
      <p>JavaScript is also very lightweight and will not bog down your computer with lots of things to remember."A lightweight programming language is one that is designed to have very small memory footprint, is easy to implement (important when porting a language), and/or has minimalist syntax and features." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_programming_language">-Wikipedia (link)</a> </p>
      <h4>Relatively Easy</h4>
        <p>JavaScript has a pretty reasonable learning curve compared to other languages. </p>

      <h4>Mobile</h4>
        <p>Javascript works just as well for mobile as it does for browser based sites and apps! This flexibility is one of the most important keys to its popularity, given the explosive popularity of mobile computing</p>
      <h4>Cloudy</h4>
      <p>Another huge trend in computing is Cloud computing, and JavaScript is fast becoming a key component of server side development using the cloud, in large part thanks to Node.js. Node.js is a software program used develope scalable network applications in JavaScript, and it is hugely popular.</p>
