      <h2>Learning Style and Challenges</h2>
      <p>Before starting DBC prep, I took the Vark Learning Style quiz and found, that I am an aural and tactile learner. I learn best by someone explaining things to me, asking questions, and then learning hands on. The DBC prep curriculem has been great for the tactile part of my brain. All of the learning we do has been hands on, with the exceptions of resources to get us started. Some of the resources we have been given have been Aural/visual in the form of videos. I love to learn this way. Sometimes we have used written resources, which I have a much harder time with, but that has been OK too.</p>
      <p>Before we started we also learned about growth vs. fixed mindsets. I found that while I had something of a growth mindset already, becoming aware of this dichotomy was extremely helpful. I decided that I would think of everything as learnable. This was very helpful coming into this challenging course and I think it should be taught at every level of schooling.</p>
      <p>The biggest challenges for me in DBC was not related to my learning style, but more related to my emotional habits. I have always prioritized challenging myself and pushing my self to the limits. I have pushed myself by taking a wide range of courses in school from Philosophy to Sociology to Business. I have traveled alone in a country where I did not speak the language. I have performed stand up comedy at hundreds of shows, some of which were among the biggest challenges of my life. However, DBC has been pushing me on an intellectual level that is new to me. It has forced me to  learned to manage my frustration. That has been the biggest challenge, and the most rewarding thing about phase 0. When we began I was having regular periods of frustration and moments of near panic that I was falling behind or not cut out for this program. During phase 0 I have had the repeated delightful experience of getting frustrated, taking a break, working on something else, coming back, asking for help and understanding the material. Now when I feel my self start to get frustrated I take a break. I have learned to skip the panic all together and have built confidence in myself. I know I can learn anything that is thrown at me. </p>
