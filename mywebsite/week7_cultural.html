    <h4>Feeling Creative</h2>
      <p>When I think about creativity as one of my core values, I feel good about myself. I've always had a flair for the dramatic, and when asserting that creatively has long been an important way for me to cope, and to thrive. </p>
      <p>Creativity is always useful in resolving conflicts or preventing them before they arise. In the context of stereotype threat, being creative is a means to the most positive end. Creative thinking is always an asset. </p>
      <p> DBC is likely going to be one of the most intensive and challenging educational experiences of my life so far. Hopefully it will lead to new challenges that will be greater still! In any environment, it is important to have some ideas about how to use one's natural strengths and values to combat negativity. One is to recognize frustration early on, and take a break before it gets overwhealming. My favorite way to use creativity to combat negativity is through humor. If my group is becoming frustrated, if I can make everyone laugh and lighten the mood, it can be good for the groups energy.</p>
      <p>Last weekend I turned 30 years old. I have been doing a lot of thinking about myself, the future I want, and the kind of person I want to be moving forward. I have learned that my pride can get in the way of being that person. I also have learned that my flair for the dramatic can be a great strenght as well as a weakness. There is the wink and a nudge drama that makes me fun to be around and fuels my comedy, and there is the voice that says "Oh, this is so hard" that can get in my way.</p>
      <p> There are two things I tell myself when I realize I am being the latter kind of dramatic. One is "Alex, stop being so dramatic." The other is a quote from one of the people I draw inspiration from the most, Elon Musk. When asked what he does when things get really hard and he loses hope, he said "I don't care about hope. I just keep working." That is the kind of beleiving in myself that will make me successful. If I remember that, and I keep my fun dramatic personality too, nothing can stop me.  </p>
