    <h2>The Centralized Web</h2>
      <p>The subjects of privacy, security, freedom, control, and surveillance are all issues that the public has recently become aware of. All of issues are of extreme importance for the future of humanity. What will the future be, a dystopian panopticon or an age of abundance and freedom from the bureaucracies and overlords of times past? If we look at these issues as political issues needing political solutions, the picture looks bleak. If, on the other hand, we view these as engineering challenges, things begin to look more managable. Consider the astounding feats of engineering humans have accomplished! Especially as compared to the astounding feats of political stagnation and gridlock that seems all to commonplace today. </p>
      <h2>If this is an engineering challenge, what is the problem?</h2>
      <p>Threats to security, freedom and privacy all have a few things in common that gives them the upper hand. Foriegn governments, the NSA, and to a lesser extent black-hat hackers, all have smart people, powerful computers, and they use these two things to gain privelaged access to the web. Smart people are everywhere, and we don't want to get rid of them. That leaves powerful computers and privelaged access. Whoever has the most money gets the most powerful computers. If you are the government, you can get the most privelaged access. You can tap right into the fiber optic cables. This is the problem. As long as there are people with the access to the world's most powerful computers and privelaged access to our information, the unprecedented power that creates WILL corrupt. There is no political solution to this. Fortunately, there is a single technicalogical one.</p>
      <h2>The Decentralized Web</h2>
      <p>Thanks to a smart piece of software, Bitcoin has no need for a central authority. By updating our software and hardware we can do the same for the web.</p>
      <p> We need to eliminate servers. Bittorrent has already shown us how to do this. Instead of information going on a central server, it gets distributed among all users. Maidsafe is a company working on <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdGH40oUVDY">how to do this for the whole web. [LINK]</a>
      <p>This would be a tremendous step in the right direction. However, even with decentralized and encrypted information, we still need to address the centralized physical infrastructure. We need to get rid of the cables. The internet is all running through giant underground cables that are controlled by governments, big companies or both. Privelaged access to these cables grants power that we cannot afford to grant. Without the need for servers, we are almost there. The technology to take us the rest of the way already exists, although it has never been implemented on a large scale. A wifi mesh is a network of computers strung together by wifi connections and looks kind of like this: </p>

      <p>The current technology is not there yet, but it is on its way.</p>
      <p>With a decentralized web every node (human) in the network has the same access to the same web. The sum of all computers on the web becomes the worlds most powerful computer. The head of the NSA, a black hat hacker, a store clerk, and a four year old all have the same access to the same "most powerful computer." The only advantage to be had is intelligence. At least until we can hook this thing up to our brains. </p>
      <p>There are many people out there, breaking these huge challenges into smaller, more managable pieces, iterating through issues and sharing solutions. In addition to MaidSafe, right here in San Francisco there is Firechat, an app that enables small scale [but scalable] wifi meshes to send and recieve texts without wifi or satelite connectivity! Twister.net.co is a decentralized microblogging platform that is immune to censorship! The list goes on. This one of the major reasons why I am attending Dev Bootcamp. I want to work on one little piece of what I view as the biggest engineering problem of the quarter century. This is our moon landing. I am optimistic. The best thing about a decentralized web is that not only is it much more secure and private, but it is also much more efficient. The move towards ever more efficient systems is embedded in the human psyche. Companies will embrace the new systems. Even governments will sign on as the efficiency is proven. This is the future of the web! But it is going to take a lot of work.
