    <h4>What is Stereotype Threat?</h2>
      <p>Everyone has a part of our identity that carries a stereotype. Sometimes that stereotype is tied to something we are doing, like an activity or test. Stereotype threat is when we feel in danger of confirming a negative stereotype about some aspect of our identity. That stress can often make us perform worse at our task, creating a self-fullfilling prophesy of sorts.</p>
      
      <h4>My Experience</h4>
      <p>I came of age as a white male in a majority African American high school. While I have experienced negative stereotypes outside of that environment, the experiences I had in high school were more impacting on me as a person. As I remember it, the three prevailing stereotypes about white people that I picked up on were:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>White people are bad at sports</li>
        <li>White people are racist </li>
        <li>White people are boring and unfunny (corny)</li>
      </ol>
      <p> The first stereotype never bothered me much because I never cared too much about sports. I do remember being more intimidated than I might have been if I was not one of the only white kids in my gym class. </p>
      <p> The second too hit close to home and affect me from time to time to this day when I am in the minority as a white person. These two come together when performing at (nearly) all black comedy clubs, which I have done a number of times. </p>
      <p> I really enjoyed listening to Professor Steele's lecture, as it helped me to think about stereotype threat as it has effected me and how it effects others. It helps me understand why, as a very funny and un-racist person I had so much anxiety performing stand up comedy for a mostly black crowd. Why would I care? I grew up with this ratio. It feels normal. I am funny and not racist. Why am I afraid that they are going to think I'm corny and racist? The fact that people have MORE anxiety when they are better prepared provided a welcomed explanation to this anxiety.</p>
      <p>What I did when faced with this anxiety in comedy clubs was to just breath and do my bit. Most of the time it went OK. Most of the time I was still less comfortable than I might have been. With this understanding of why I was so anxious, I would be in a better spot. Next time I will keep in mind the source of this anxiety! If I am in a situation of needing feedback for something I feel a stereotype threat about, I will ask for something specific. Like, "Do you think that fart joke could be worded better?" As opposed to "How'd I do?" If I am in a position of giving someone else feedback, and I think that they might feel a stereotype threat, I would say something to make it clear that I am not regarding them or their work in light of that stereotype.</p>
